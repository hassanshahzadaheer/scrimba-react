# Project Setup Challenge

Welcome to the Project Setup Challenge! In this challenge, you will set up a local development environment for a React app and create some basic components.

## Challenge Steps

1. Create a `components` folder.
2. Inside the `components` folder, create separate files for the following components. Each component should render an `<h1>` with the name of the component. For example: `return <h1>Navbar goes here</h1>`:
    - Navbar
    - Main
3. Create an `App` component outside the `components` folder (sibling to the `index.js` file). The `App` component should render the `Navbar` and `Main` components.
4. Import and render the `App` component inside the `index.js` file using ReactDOM. At this point, you should see the "Navbar goes here" and other components showing up in the mini-browser.
5. Visit Google Fonts and obtain the "Inter" font with weights 400, 600, and 700.
6. Place the links to the "Inter" fonts ABOVE the `style.css` link in the `index.html` file. Use `<link/>` elements instead of `@import` or npm options for font loading. You might need to do some extra research if you're unfamiliar with this process.

Feel free to tackle these steps in your preferred order. Good luck and have fun with the challenge!
