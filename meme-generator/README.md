# Simple React Project with States and Props

This project is a part of my learning journey to understand how to work with React states and props. I've completed this project as part of the Scrimba course, which has been an excellent resource for gaining a deeper understanding of React.

## Overview

In this project, I've explored the fundamental concepts of React states and props. These concepts are crucial to building dynamic and interactive web applications with React. Here's a brief overview of what I've learned:

- **States:** I've learned how to manage component states to store and handle dynamic data within my React components. States allow me to update and render information dynamically as the user interacts with the application.

- **Props:** I've grasped the concept of props (short for properties) and how to pass data from parent components to child components. This enables me to create reusable and modular components in my React application.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `src/`: This directory contains the source code for the React application.
  - `components/`: Contains individual React components, including those that utilize states and props.
  - `App.js`: The main application component.
  - `index.js`: Entry point for the React application.

## Getting Started

2. Navigate to the project directory using `cd`.

3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.

4. Start the development server using `npm start`.

5. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

## Credits

I want to express my gratitude to Scrimba for providing an excellent course that helped me understand React states and props. The course has been a valuable resource in my journey to become proficient in React development.
